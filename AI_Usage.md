AI Assistance
=============
This page will document all uses of AI assistance per the requirements. 

Note that I have an extension installed in my browser to block Google's incredibly annoying and incompitent AI Overview. For the purposes of this document, anything from research to ideas to code generated in whole or in part by ChatGPT, CoPilot, or any other AI assistance will be tracked. 

However, general research (Google, StackOverflow, Reddit, etc...) will not be tracked as it does not fall into the scope of AI despite how much overlap there is in their particular use cases in recent years.
