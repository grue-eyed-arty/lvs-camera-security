To-Do
=============

6) Make a requirements.txt file to quickly install dependencies. (Do at end with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)
7) Add exception handling for missing configurations
8) Find a less ugly way to close the program (keyboard module doesn't work on mac).
9) Figure out how to have the webcam stream to an HTTP server, then have my program read from that server.
10) Write tests for specifically checking that my log files are FILES and not a buch of ****ing directories (this one's annoying me.)
11) Handle the error of webcam disconnection
