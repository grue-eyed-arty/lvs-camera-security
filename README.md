Arturo McGill LVS Coding Assignment
===================================

Overview
--------
This is a simple security system that will monitor the system's webcam for events, and logs said events in JSON files.

Technology/Packages Used
------------------------
* [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
    * This package provides support for grabbing a video feed from a live capture device such as a camera.    

Assumptions
-----------
* The webcam being used is the only one connected to the host machine. In other words, `CV2.VideoCapture(0)` returns the webcam we care about.

Examples
--------
* Both for myself as a developer, and for whoever is reviewing this project, I have includes an Examples folder with example code provided by the developers of the various packges. This is both for just the sake of providing an example, as well as for providing me as the developer a playground to work with.
